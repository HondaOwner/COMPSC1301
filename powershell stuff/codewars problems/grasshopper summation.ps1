# Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num.
# The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

# For example (Input -> Output):

# 2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
# 8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

function Summation([int] $n) {
  $sum = 
  # always positive and greater than 0
  # takes the number and in descending order makes a sum function of all of them and then
  # does the math to add all of those together to reach a summation

# Chapter 1.4

- Each call to print() outputs a new line. However, Sometimes a programmer may want to keep the output on the same line in java this is like println and print, print would make it same line but in python.
Which is where "end= ' ') comes from

## Sytnax

    Example:
    Including end=' ' keeps output on same line
    
    print('Hello there.', end=' ')
    print('My name is...', end=' ')
    print('Carl?')

### Output

    Hello there. My name is... Carl?

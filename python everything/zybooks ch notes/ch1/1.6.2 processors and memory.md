# Processors and Memory

## Processors

- To support different calculations, circuits called processors, were created to process (aka execute) a list of desired calculations, each calculation called an instruction.
The instructions were specified by configuring external switches, as in the figure below. PRocessors used to take up en tire rooms, but today fit on a chip about the size of a postage stamp, containing millions or even billions of switches.

## Memory

- Instructions are stored in a memory. a memory is a circuit that can store 0s and 1s in each of a series of thousands of addressed locations, like a series of addressed mailboxes that each can store an envelope (the 0s and 1s).
- Instructions operate on data, which is also stored in memory locations as 0s and 1s.
- Thus, a computer is basically a processor interacting with a memory. In the following example, a computer's processor executes program instructions stored in memory, also using the memory to store temporary results. The example program converts an hourly wage ($20/hr) into an annual salary by multiplying by 40 (hours/week) and then by 52 (weeks/year), outputting the final result to the screen.

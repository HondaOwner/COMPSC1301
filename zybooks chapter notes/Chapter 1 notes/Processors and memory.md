# Processors and memory

## Processors

to support different calculations, circuits called processors, were created to process (aka execute) a list of desired calculations, each calculation called an instruction.
The instructions were specified by configuring external switches, as in the figure below. PRocessors used to take up en tire rooms, but today fit on a chip about the size of a postage stamp, containing millions or even billions of switches.

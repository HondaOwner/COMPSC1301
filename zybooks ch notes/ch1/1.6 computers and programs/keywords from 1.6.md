# Keywords from 1.6

## Compiler

- Translates a high-level language program into low-level machine instructions.
- A compiler ensures a program is valid according to the language's rules, performs optimizations, then converts to the low-level machine instructions.

## Application

- Another word for program.
- The programmer-created sequence of instructions is called a program, application, or just app.

## Machine instruction

- A series of 0s and 1s(bits), stored in a memory, that tells a processor to carry out a particular operation like a multiplication.
0s and 1s are hard to comprehend. Most programmers specify the program's functionality in a high-level language, which is then automatically translated to low-level machine instructions.

## Assembly language

- Human-readable processor instructions
- An assembler is a program that translates assembly language instructions into machine instructions.

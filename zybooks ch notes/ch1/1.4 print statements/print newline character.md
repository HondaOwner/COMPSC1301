# Newline characters

- Output can be moved to the next line by printing "\n", known as a newline character.

## Example: print('1\n2\n3')

- prints "1" on the first line, "2" on the second line, and "3" on the third line of output.

- "\n" consists of two characters, \ and n, but together are considered by the Python interpreter as a single character.

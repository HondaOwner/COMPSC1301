# 2.1 Variables and Assignments

## Variables

- In a program, a variable is a named item, such as x or num_people, used to hold a value.

## Assignments

- An assignment statement assigns a variable with a value, such as x = 5. That statement means x is assigned with 5, and x keeps that value during subsequent statements, until x is assigned again.
- An assignment statement's left side must be a variable, so a statement may be x = 5, y =x, or z = x + 2. THe 5, x, and x + 2 are each an expression that evaluates to a value

## Keynotes

An assignment statement's left side MUST be a variable, meaning you can not assign it on the right side

### Example

- var_car = int(input)
- Is valid because it is assigned on the left side
- However int(input) = var_car, is not valid.

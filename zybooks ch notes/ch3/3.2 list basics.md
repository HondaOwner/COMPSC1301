# 3.2 List basics

## Creating a list

- A container is a construct used to group related values together and contains references to other objects instead of data. A list is a container created by surrounding a sequence of variables or literals with brackets[].

### List Example

    - Ex: my_list = [10, 'abc'] creates a new list variable my_list that contains the two items: 10 and 'abc'. 
    - A list item is called an element.

## Continuing with lists

- A list is also a sequence, meaning the contained elements are ordered by position in the list, known as the element's index, starting with 0.
- my_list = [ ] creates an empty list.
- A list itself is an object, and its value is a sequence of references to the list's elements.

## Accessing list elements

- Lists are useful for reducing the number of variables in a program. Instead of having a separate variable for the name of every student in a class, or for every word in an email, a single list can store an entire collection of related variables.
- Individual list elements can be accessed using an indexing expression by using brackets as in my_list[i], where i is an integer. This allows a programmer to quickly find the i'th element in a list.
- A list's index must be an integer. The index cannot be a floating-point type, even if the value is a whole number like 0.0 or 1.0. Using any type besides an integer will produce a runtime error and the program will terminate.

## Updating list elements

- <Lists are mutable
- Meaning that a programmer can change a list's contents. An element can be updated with a new value by performing an assignment to a position in the list.

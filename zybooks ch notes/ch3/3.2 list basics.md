# 3.2 List basics

## Creating a list

- A container is a construct used to group related values together and contains references to other objects instead of data. A list is a container created by surrounding a sequence of variables or literals with brackets[].

### List Example

    - Ex: my_list = [10, 'abc'] creates a new list variable my_list that contains the two items: 10 and 'abc'. 
    - A list item is called an element.

# The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and then 1 follows. 
# All subsequent values are the sum of the previous two, ex: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. 
# Complete the fibonacci() function, which has an index n as parameter and returns the nth value in the sequence. 
# Any negative index values should return -1.

# FIXME: Note: Use a for loop and DO NOT use recursion.
